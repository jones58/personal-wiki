I use [Letterboxd](https://letterboxed.com/rknightuk) which then feeds into [Almanac](https://almanac.rknight.me/?category=movie) via RSS to track what movies I've watched.

## Letterboxd

I like the social aspect of Letterboxd and it's a nice website to use. I also maintain [a few lists](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/lists/) including:

- [‎Defocused Podcast](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/list/defocused-podcast/)
- [‎MCU Ranked](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/list/mcu-ranked/)
- [‎Fast and Furious Ranked](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/list/fast-and-furious-ranked/)
- [‎Egdar Wright Movies Ranked](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/list/egdar-wright-movies-ranked/)


## Marvel Cinematic Universe Viewing Order

There's some debate about what the "correct" order is for watching the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) movies (and now TV shows).

I don't think watching in [chronological order](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/mcu-ultimate-viewing-order/) makes sense if you've never seen them before. You lose a lot of the joy of the reveals (like Fury and Coulson in Captain Marvel) and the after credits scenes need to be skipped in order to avoid spoilers.
