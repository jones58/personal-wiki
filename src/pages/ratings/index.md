## Media Ratings

I use a three-star rating system for things I've watched or read, I have no interest in trying to distinguish between a three and four star movie (or god forbid half-ratings). If the site I'm using has ratings out of five (like [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)) I only use the first, third, and fifth star.

★☆☆ : Never again
★★☆ : Fine
★★★ : Good movie, would watch again


## Gig Worker Ratings

Unless my Uber driver literally kills me, they're getting a 5. Don't be a dick.
