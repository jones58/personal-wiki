I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rknightuk) to shit post and [tell David Darnes when he's done a good tweet](https://twitter.com/rknightuk/status/1318880017280098304). I don't follow news accounts and I follow very few brands. I use [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot) on the Mac and iOS.

I have [Facebook](https://facebook.com) but I really only use it for selling stuff on Marketplace. I know I should close my account, but it's really useful being able to get rid of my old stuff quickly.

[Instagram](https://instagram.com/rknightuk) is a "happy place" as [Myke Hurley](https://twitter.com/imyke) has described it multiple times. The ads have become excessive of recent months though. I want an alternative to Instagram at some point, I think [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/) is the best option but I need to investigate it further.
