title: Gaming

I only game on consoles, I've never owned a gaming PC. I can't play first-person games because it makes me nauseous. I rarely play online with the exception of [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) and [Fall Guys](https://www.mediatonicgames.com/game/fall-guys).

My PSN username is `rknightuk`.

I use [Almanac](https://almanac.rknight.me/?category=game) to track what games I've played and [GameEye](https://gameye.app/) to catalog my games.

## Current Consoles

I own a lot of consoles and it gets pretty hard trying to hook them all up to one TV (I don't think it's even possible at this point).

- PS5
- PS3
- PS2 Slim - one black, one pink
- PS1
- Xbox One
- Xbox 360
- Switch
- Wii
- N64
- Sega Master System

For everything else pre-PS1/N64, I use [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/).

## PS5 Controller Plates

I bought [these replacements for the front plate of my PS5 controllers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001946860557.html) from AliExpress and they [look fantastic](https://twitter.com/rknightuk/status/1435570309025906690).
