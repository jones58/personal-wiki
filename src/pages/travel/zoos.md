title: Zoos

We generally visit at least one zoo every year. These are my favourites:

- [Cotswold Wildlife Park and Gardens](https://www.cotswoldwildlifepark.co.uk/) - This has a great layout, allows dogs, and a lot of the enclosures are way more "open" than some other zoos. You can stand right next to the penguins and (theoretically) touch them.
- [Paradise Wildlife Park](https://www.pwpark.com/) - Feeding the Lemurs here was amazing.
- [ZSL London Zoo](https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo) - Really great, much better than it's other site at [Whipsnade](https://www.zsl.org/zsl-whipsnade-zoo) which feels kind of empty.
