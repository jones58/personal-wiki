These are the AirBNBs I've been to that I would recommend. I've linked to other websites where I can because AirBNBs fees are insane.

- [Malvern Hills Lodge](https://www.visitthemalverns.org/accommodation/malvern-hills-lodge/) - This place is incredible. Pricey, but worth it.
- [The Hide Away, Powys, Wales](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15130066)
- [Ashlea Lakeside Retreat](https://www.ashlealakesideretreat.co.uk/) - (relatively) cheap place to getaway for a few days.

## Windmill Retreat, Edlesborough

[Windmill Retreat, Edlesborough](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/18494069) deserves it's own section. From my review on AirBNB:

> We broke down about 10 miles away on our way to the windmill, the car battery was dead. We were able to get it to a local garage after the breakdown people arrived and then we walked the mile to the windmill - this was 8pm-ish so the garage was closed.

The next day Lizzie, the host, dealt with everything: called the garage, dropped the keys off to them, gave us a lift to the zoo, then called us when the car was fixed and ready to pick up.
