## Notes

Rates for mortgages generally improve as you go up each 5% on your loan-to-value ratio.

## Fixed Rate

Fixed for a specific amount of time at a certain percentage. e.g. 5 years at 2.5%.

## Tracker

Rate is tracked against the [Bank of England base rate](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate) so it can fluctuate depending on that rate.

## Overpayments

Overpaying, even a small amount each month, can knock years off the length of a mortgage. [Money Saving Expert's mortage overpayment calculator](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-overpayment-calculator/) is great for working this out.

## Porting Mortgages

Essentially, "Porting" a mortgage means "keep this mortgage but link it to a different house". If you port when buying a house that costs more, you have to get a second mortgage for the rest. Example (without any deposits/equity for simplicity):

- House 1 has a mortgage of £100k
- House 2 costs £150k
- To port to house 2, you would keep the 100k mortgage then get _another_ mortgage for £50k

Keep in mind if the either mortgage is on a fixed rate term, that it can be difficult to remortgage back into one mortgage again so it's worth considering putting the second one on a tracker until the fixed term is finished on the first.

I don't know how it works if house 2 is cheaper than house 1.
