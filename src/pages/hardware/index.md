Stuff I'm using:

- 2019 16" MacBook Pro
- [MX Master 3 Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005694.html) - This is the best mouse, no question.
- iPhone 12
- iPad Air 3
- [Deco M5 mesh system](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/home-networking/deco/deco-m5/#deco)
- A 2014 Mac Mini for [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). It's old but it still does the job perfectly.
- 2 of these [HiSense H43M3000](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/5e5b5fd) 42" 4K TVs. These are cheap, the "smart" stuff is terrible but the picture and sound quality is excellent. [Close to perfect](https://rknight.me/getting-closer-to-the-perfect-tv/).
- [Wave Case](https://www.wavecase.co.uk) - I have these for my iPhone and my AirTags.

I have a single "smart" home item which is a smart plug for turning an electric blanket on in the winter. I'm convinced a lot of smart home stuff is more trouble than it's worth. 

I don't remember who said this on a podcast, but I think about this a lot in relation to smart homes (paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact quote)
