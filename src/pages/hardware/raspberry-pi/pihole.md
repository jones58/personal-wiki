title: Pi-hole
---

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) is a "_DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content_". It's lightweight so it can run on pretty much anything including the original Raspberry Pi.

You can get basic stats about blocked requests at `http://<Your pihole address>/admin/api.php`.

The dashboard is accessible at `http://pi.hole` by default. You don't need to add it to your hosts file like I did.
