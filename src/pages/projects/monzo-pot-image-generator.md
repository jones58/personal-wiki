[Monzo](https://monzo.com) has [a feature called pots](https://monzo.com/help/budgeting-overdrafts-savings/what-is-a-pot)  which are "_a space in your account where you can separate out your money from your main balance_". This site generates these pot images by choosing backgrounds (solid, gradient, image) and an icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com).
