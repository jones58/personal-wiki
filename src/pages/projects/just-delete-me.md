title: Just Delete Me
---

Just Delete Me was a site I created with [Ed Poole](https://edpoole.me) in 2013 (and sold in 2016). It was:

> A directory of direct links to delete your account from web services

I still hate that description. The site is [still online](https://justdelete.me) but hasn't been updated since it was purchased.

It went viral and the site was featured all over the place and I was interviewed by online news sites and even [a real newspaper](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/just-delete-me-how-to-delete-unwanted-website-accounts-20130830-2svm4.html).

At one point I set up a Google form to collect suggestions from people and then I forgot about it. About 6 months later I went into the form and found I had hundreds of peoples emails and passwords for various accounts asking _me_ to delete their accounts. I promptly deleted that spreadsheet and form.
