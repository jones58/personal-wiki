[View my projects on Github](https://github.com/rknightuk?tab=repositories)

I tend to open source most of my projects but there always comes a time where someone files an issue or opens a PR and I just don't want the feature, or they've misunderstood what I'm using the project for. I saw this line on one of [Andy Bell's](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/11ty-base) repos the other day:

> Please don’t submit issues or PRs. I’m just sharing this for people that might want a decent starter. This isn’t open source: just free. Thanks.

I think I might start adding that to my repositories going forward.
