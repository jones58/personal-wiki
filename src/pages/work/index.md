[On the Effect of Noise on Software Engineersâ€™ Performance: Results from Two Replicated Experiments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226332)
DOI: 10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00062

> The results suggest that noise: (i) does not significantly affect the comprehension of functional requirements specifications and (ii) significantly affects fault fixing if this task lasts less than 30 minutes while it does not have a significant impact if the task lasts 60 minutes.

> the results from our replications and those form the baseline experiments suggest that bug fixing is more vulnerable to noise than comprehending the specifications of functional requirement
