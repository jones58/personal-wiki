title: LaMetric TIME Alternative
---

[LaMetric TIME](https://lametric.com/en-US) is a "connected clock for a smart home" but:

- It's expensive
- It relies on their app and API so might become obsolete quickly

## Notes

- WS2812B LEDs

## Existing Projects

- [mrusme/lemon: Lemon – LED Monitor – is a $79.43 opensource alternative to LaMetric that supports GitHub-, IFTTT- and Zapier-webhooks and even integrates with Pushover!](https://github.com/mrusme/lemon)
