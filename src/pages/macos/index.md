title: MacOS
---

I use MacOS as my primary OS on a 2019 16" MacBook Pro.

There are a number of tweaks and settings I toggle on a fresh install which you can view [in my dot files](https://github.com/rknightuk/dotfiles/blob/master/osx/set-defaults.sh). These dotfiles also include scripts to install all of the apps and command line tools I use.

## Dock

I have my dock hidden with no apps in it by default. I launch everything with [Alfred](/macos/alfred)

## Apps

You can view a close-to-up-to-date list of apps I install in my [brewfile on GitHub](https://github.com/rknightuk/dotfiles/blob/master/homebrew/Brewfile).

I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) to manage my passwords, credit cards, and software licences.

Notes, Reminders, Mail and Safari are all my defaults for those tasks.

## Menu Bar Apps

[Gitify](https://www.gitify.io/) puts your Github notifications in the menu bar. Way better than endless emails.

[Batteries for Mac](https://www.fadel.io/batteries) shows battery status of my MacBook, keyboard, mouse, and iPhone.

[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) is an excellent calendar app. It does have a full app but I never use that.

[xbar](https://xbarapp.com) (formally BitBar) "_lets you put the output from any script/program in your macOS menu bar._". I have two plugins: microphone mute and now playing. [View my xbar plugins on Github](https://github.com/rknightuk/xbar-plugins). [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) is another version of BitBar although it wasn't compatible with my plugins.

[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) for screenshots, screen recording, and annotation.

I show and hide certain menu bar apps and icons with [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/).

## Adding Custom Alert Sounds

Put the audio files in `~/Library/Sounds` and they show up in Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects.

## List All URL Schemes

```bash
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump URLSchemeBinding
```

## Developer Folder

4. Press delete on the keyboard 
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 if necessary
