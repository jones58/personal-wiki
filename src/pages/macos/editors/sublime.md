title: Sublime Text
---

~~I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for all of my writing and most of my personal projects.~~ I've mostly switched to [VSCode](/macos/editors/vscode/).

You can view all [my Sublime preferences on Github](https://github.com/rknightuk/dotfiles/tree/master/prefs/sublime).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>command ⌘</kbd> <kbd>shift ⇧</kbd> <kbd>l</kbd> to multi-line edit the current selection
- <kbd>command ⌘</kbd> <kbd>shift ⇧</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> for global search
- <kbd>⌥</kbd> <kbd>enter</kbd> when searching to select all occurances for multi-line editing
- Set this in Preferences > Key Bindings for a save all files shortcut `{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+alt+s"], "command": "save_all" }`

## Packages

### GhostText

[GhostText](https://github.com/fregante/GhostText) is a package that, along with the browser extension allows me to open any text field on the web in Sublime to edit it there instead.

### Markdown Editing

This [Markdown Editing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) package adds better syntax highlighting for Markdown as well as some other nice features (like add in `-` when you're writing lists).

### Marked App Menu

[This package](https://github.com/icio/sublime-text-marked) adds an option to open the current file in [Marked](https://marked2app.com/).
