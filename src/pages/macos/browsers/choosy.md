title: Choosy
---

Choosy is a "default" browser. You can set rules for specific links (e.g. Github links open in Chrome, any link from Tweetbot opens in Safari). I run Safari for personal and Chrome for work so this is really handy. If there's no rule to match, you choose which browser to open in when you click a link.

## Rules

These are some of the rules I have set to manage links.

- Address contains `music.apple.com`, open in Apple Music
- Address contains `sentry.io`, `basecamp.com`, `github.com`, `intercom.com`, `circleci`, open in Chrome (work browser)
- Links clicked in Mail or Messages always open in Safari

You can see all of [my choosy rules on Github](https://github.com/rknightuk/dotfiles/tree/master/prefs/choosy).
