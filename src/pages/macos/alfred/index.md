[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), at it's core, is a launcher for MacOS but has a huge number of other features that make it impossible for me to work without it.

## Features

### Themes

Alfred has a theming system (you can even switch themes for light and dark mode). I tend to use themes other people have made instead of making my own. My current favourite is [Tempo Alternative](https://github.com/chrismessina/alfred-theme-tempo#tempo-alternative-dark).

Chris Messina [has the best themes](https://github.com/chrismessina?tab=repositories&q=alfred-theme).

### Workflows

Workflows in Alfred are user-made scripts that can automate tasks like [getting all Safari tabs as markdown](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/safari-tabs-markdown) or [switching audio device](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/audio-device-selector).

I've made a [number of my own workflows](https://rknight.me/alfred-workflows/).

[Starred Alfred workflows list on Github](https://github.com/stars/rknightuk/lists/alfred-workflows).

Using workflows requires the [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).

### Clipboard History

If you've never used a clipboard manager before, you're missing out. Alfred can keep clipboard history for up to three months which has saved me more times than I care to count.

### Snippets

Snippets is like a light version of [Text Expander](https://textexpander.com). I have snippets setup for my email addresses, phone numbers, as well as common phrases I tend to type a lot.

Examples:

- `;em` expands to my email address
- `;tm` it switches out to `™`. Very useful for Good Twitter Jokes™
- `;ebay` expands to the exact same feedback I always leave on eBay

### Other features I use

-  Bookmark search - search my Safari and Chrome bookmarks by typing `bm {query}`
-  Mini music player
-  System commands like shut down, restart, empty trash, quit all apps

## Fix for Snippets Not Working in VSCode

> Alfred Preferences > Snippets > Auto Expansion Options > Tweaking and setting Simulated key event speed to 4/5 (the level below fastest)
