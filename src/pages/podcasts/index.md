I listen to podcasts with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) on my iPhone.

Most of the podcasts I listen to are from [Relay](https://relay.fm) and [The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/). Exceptions to this:

- [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)
- [AppStories](https://appstories.net/)
- [Unhelpful Suggestions](https://unhelpful-suggestions.com/)
- [Hello Internet](https://www.hellointernet.fm/)

Hello Internet has an RSS issue where only the last 100 show up. Here is [a feed of episodes 1-50 of Hello Internet](https://github.com/yottalogical/hello-internet-archive) that you can subscribe to. I also have my own archive of all the episodes.

I also have my own podcast, [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com). Read my [notes on podcast production](/podcasts/production).

## Get Incomparable Titles and Links

Used when generating the initial versions of my [Defocused list on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/list/defocused-podcast/).

```js
titles = document.getElementsByClassName('asset-name entry-title')

data = []
for (var i = 0; i < titles.length; i++) {
    const title = titles[0].innerText
    const link = titles[i].children[0].href
    data.push({ title, link })
}
```
