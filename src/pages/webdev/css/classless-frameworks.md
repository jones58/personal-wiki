title: Classless Frameworks
---

Classless CSS "frameworks" are great for quick prototyping or even as a base for a small project.

Ones I've used (including on this site):

- [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css)
- [Sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura)
- [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

## Links
