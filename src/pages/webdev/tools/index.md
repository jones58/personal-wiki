## Access localhost from Mac on an iPhone or iPad

- Plug in the device to the Mac
- Open `Preferences > Sharing`
- `Internet Sharing` and check the iPhone or iPad then tick `Internet Sharing`


_In theory_, you should now be able to access `localhost` or `computername.local` from the device but this didn't work for me. I had to grab my local IP address and then access it that way (`192.168.1.100:port`).
