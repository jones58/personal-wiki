title: Static Site Generators
---

Static site generators turn files (markdown, html, json, whatever) into HTML files for statically loading from your server (or even [serverless](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/)). These can be hosted pretty much anywhere because it's (usually) just plain HTML, css, and Javascript.

## Eleventy

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) is what I've been using for the past couple of years because of it's flexability. The plugin system, filters, and various other features make it perfect for building all kinds of sites. [This site is built with it](/meta), [my personal site is](https://rknight.me) as well as the [Monzo Pot Image Generator](/projects/monzo-pot-image-generator/).

## Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a ruby-based static site generator which [Github has built-in support for](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) making it pretty popular. Right up until you have to manage Ruby dependencies, which is why I stopped using it.

## Hexo

[Hexo](https://hexo.io) is easy to use and has a ton of themes available. Runs on node.
