title: Backups
---

I use [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01gkf3) to backup the contents of my entire computer. Thankfully I've never needed it but for ~$60 a year it's worth the peace of mind.

Although not strictly a "backup", I use ~~[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)~~ iCloud Drive for all my documents. I'm not a fan of what Dropbox has become but it's still the most solid syncing app.~~ I've used [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) in the past but found their desktop app to be inconsistent at best.

All my code is backed up to [Github](https://github.com).

My [dotfiles](/cli/) are all on Github ready for me to install on a new machine if the worst happens.

## Notes

If your backup isn't automatic, it's not a backup.
