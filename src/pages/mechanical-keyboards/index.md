## Notes

I don't currently have a mechanical keyboard but I keep eyeing up various keycaps and keyboards.

"Group Buy" is a just a preorder assuming enough people join the group buy. Basically no keyboard companies seem to have actual stock of anything.

I ordered a [Meka Mat Black](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/meka-mat-black_591/) from [iLumkb](https://ilumkb.com/) and despite them being in Singapore it arrived within a few days.
