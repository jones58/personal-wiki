# Intersect

<img src="src/_eleventy/assets/img/logos/readme_logo.png" alt="Intersect Logo">

A personal wiki built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).

Demo: [http://intersect.rknight.me](http://intersect.rknight.me)

To paraphrase [Andy Bell](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/11ty-base):

> Please don’t submit issues or PRs. I’m just sharing this for other people to make thier own wikis. This isn’t open source: just free.

If there's some huge breaking issue, then by all means file an issue and let me know but I'll only be building features I want which is unlikely to be the same features any one else wants.

## Basic Usage

All pages are stored in `src/pages` so put your pages in here. These must be markdown for the headings ID links to work but they can, in theory, be `njk` or anything else Eleventy supports.
